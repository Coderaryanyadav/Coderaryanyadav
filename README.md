# 👋 Hey, I'm Aryan Yadav

I'm a 17-year-old programmer and aspiring ethical hacker from Mumbai, India. I enjoy exploring how systems work — and how to make (or break) them. I spend most of my time learning programming, cybersecurity, and networking from the ground up.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning & Building

I’m focused on mastering:

- Programming fundamentals (Python, C++, Java)
- Web development (frontend + backend basics)
- Ethical hacking, bug bounty, and cybersecurity
- Networking (OSI model, TCP/IP, packet sniffing, etc.)
- System architecture, Linux, and terminal-based tools
