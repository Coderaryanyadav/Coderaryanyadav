# Aryan Yadav

I am a 17-year-old programmer and aspiring cybersecurity professional based in Mumbai, India. I have a deep interest in ethical hacking, system security, and full-stack development. My focus is on building a solid foundation in computer science, while simultaneously developing real-world skills in cybersecurity, networking, and software engineering.

## Profile Summary

I’m a self-driven learner who believes in mastering the fundamentals and learning by doing. I’ve dedicated hundreds of hours to practical coding, penetration testing labs, and high-quality technical courses. I’m not just studying theory — I apply what I learn through hands-on projects, challenges, and continuous self-assessment.

Despite my age, I’ve already completed several industry-recognized courses and consistently practice on platforms like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, LeetCode, and Codeforces. I’m actively building tools, scripts, and small projects that reflect both my technical knowledge and problem-solving approach.
